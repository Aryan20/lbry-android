[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lbryio/lbry-android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lbryio/lbry-android)
The LBRY Android app running the Python lbrynet-daemon as a background service and a UI layer built with React Native. The APK is built using buildozer and the Gradle build tool.

## Installation
The minimum supported Android version is 5.0 Lollipop. There are currently 2 options for obtaining the APK. The latest APK release can be downloaded from http://build.lbry.io/android/latest.apk. You will need to enable installation from third-party sources on your device in order to install from this source. The other option is to install from the Google Play Store.

## Usage
The app can be launched by opening **LBRY Browser** from the device's app drawer or a shortcut on the homescreen if that was created upon install.

## Running from Source
The app can be built from source using `buildozer`. The first thing you will need to do after cloning the repository is create a `buildozer.spec` file. You can base your spec on the provided sample file `buildozer.spec.sample`. Please read [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for detailed build instructions.
